# Logistic_Network_Optimization
AMPL and CPLEX will be used to optimize a logistic network.

Use the .run to run the solver and see the optimized results. If you want you can modify the files in order to change the layout of the problem. This might lead to uncorrect results or non optimal solutions, so be weary of that.
